Train the models on data from 2021 - 2022 ¤
Train both ARIMA and LSTM and compare their predictions (Use RMSE) ¤
Graph RMSE models, calculate each day's deviation ¤
Try predicting by feeding the model multiple timesteps (for both models) (G(t), G(t-1), G(t-2), ...) ¤
Learn ARIMA's definition ¤

Analyze the model's inner mechanisms:
1) Verify inputs and outputs
2) Verify dataset

Given recent weather conditions, what is the expected PV system power for the day ahead?

BASE CASE: LSTM Score of Solar Energy Predictions With 400 Units LSTM and 150 Units Dense (Batch Size 24): 827.898 - Roughly 150 minutes
FIRST CASE: LSTM Score of Solar Energy Predictions With 200 Units LSTM and 100 Units Dense (Batch Size 24): 856.822
SECOND CASE: LSTM Score of Solar Energy Predictions With 200 Units LSTM and 100 Units Dense (Batch Size 72): 864.777 - 83 minutes and 15.9 seconds # An RMSE increase of 4.45% for 44.49% more efficiency
THIRD CASE: LSTM Score of Solar Energy Predictions With 600 Units LSTM and 250 Units Dense (Batch Size 24): 852.964 - 548 minutes # The accuracy increase is negligible when compared to the extremely inefficient performance
